# Pixel Sketchpad

This is a simple sketch-pad made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to create pixel art by coloring individual cells on a grid. The sketch-pad is responsive and can be used on any device with a modern web browser.

## Getting Started
To use the sketch-pad, simply visit the [live demo] (https://cebotaritigran.github.io/pixel-sketchpad/) in your web browser. Alternatively, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine and open index.html in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
When you first load the sketch-pad, you'll see a grid of cells that you can color by clicking and dragging with your mouse. You can change the size of the grid by adjusting the "Grid Size" slider at the top of the page.

You can also change the color of the current drawing tool by selecting a color from the "Color Picker" at the top of the page. The current color will be displayed in the small square next to the color picker.

To clear the entire grid and start over, click the "Reset" button.
